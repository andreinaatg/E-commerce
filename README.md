Miwa Asian Beauty - E-commerce Project

Welcome to Miwa, an e-commerce platform specializing in authentic Asian beauty products from Korea and Japan. This repository contains the codebase for the Miwa website, where users can explore a wide range of skincare, makeup, and other beauty products.

Features
Product Listings: The website features a variety of Asian beauty products, including creams, cleansers, serums, toners, and more. Product listings are dynamically generated from a JSON file, allowing for easy management and scalability.

Responsive Design: Miwa is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices of all sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Navigation: Users can easily navigate through the website using the navigation menu located in the header. The menu includes links to the home page, shop page, and contact page.

Sidebar Navigation: A sidebar navigation menu is available for easy access to different sections of the website. The sidebar can be toggled open and closed using the hamburger menu icon.

Form Validation: The website implements JavaScript form validation to ensure that user-submitted data is accurate and complete. Form fields are validated for name, email, phone number, and message before submission.

Product Slider: The home page features a product slider implemented using the Glider.js library. This allows users to easily scroll through featured products and promotions.
